/*
    DOM - DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
          Object{} that represents the page you see in the web browser
          and provide you with an API to interact with it.

          Web browser constricts the DOM when it load an HTML document,
          and structures all the elements in a tree-like representation.
          JavaScript can access the DOM to dynamically
          change the content, structure, and style of the webpage.
